our task here is to predict salaries which are continuous variables. This is a
regression problem. we choose Linear Regression because the Linear regression
assumes a relationship between input features(x) and output target(y). y can be
calculated from a linear combination of x. Out of all the methods I used, It gave a
RMSE of 18.77 and an R2 score of 0.76. Based on these scores, I pick this
method to predict the salaries on the given test data.
